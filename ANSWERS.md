- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
We're able to work with the lifecycle when working inside of a class component.
- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
First stage of the life cycle of mounting is to set up our component with state and props before in order to render.
Second stage is making sure that the state will update when the state on our component has been modified/submitted.
Third stage is essentially the death of the component. When the component has served its purpose or a user has not met the conditions of pre-set conditions, the component will be unmounted along with its state.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
A custom hook allows us to set up a piece of our website with functionality and can utilize the state of the class component.
- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
We need to test our app because there are some unexpected side effects to some of the code we write and sometimes it wont work the way it was intended.
